# You are given an integer array nums consisting of unique integers.
#
# Originally, nums contained every integer within a certain range. However, some integers might have gone missing from the array.
#
# The smallest and largest integers of the original range are still present in nums.
#
# Return a sorted list of all the missing integers in this range. If no integers are missing, return an empty list.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
# Input: nums = [1,4,2,5]
#
# Output: [3]
#
# Explanation:
#
# The smallest integer is 1 and the largest is 5, so the full range should be [1,2,3,4,5]. Among these, only 3 is missing.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: nums = [7,8,6,9]
#
# Output: []
#
# Explanation:
#
# The smallest integer is 6 and the largest is 9, so the full range is [6,7,8,9]. All integers are already present, so no integer is missing.
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: nums = [5,1]
#
# Output: [2,3,4]
#
# Explanation:
#
# The smallest integer is 1 and the largest is 5, so the full range should be [1,2,3,4,5]. The missing integers are 2, 3, and 4.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 2 <= nums.length <= 100
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
