#You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.
#
# -1 - A wall or an obstacle. 0 - A gate. INF - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value 231 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than 2147483647. Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with INF.
#
# For example, given the 2D grid:
#
# INF  -1  0  INF
# INF INF INF  -1
# INF  -1 INF  -1
#   0  -1 INF INF
# After running your function, the 2D grid should be:
#
#   3  -1   0   1
#   2   2   1  -1
#   1  -1   2  -1
#   0  -1   3   4
