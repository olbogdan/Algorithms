# You are given a positive integer n, representing an n x n city. You are also given a 2D grid buildings, where buildings[i] = [x, y] denotes a unique building located at coordinates [x, y].
#
# A building is covered if there is at least one building in all four directions: left, right, above, and below.
#
# Return the number of covered buildings.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
#
# Input: n = 3, buildings = [[1,2],[2,2],[3,2],[2,1],[2,3]]
#
# Output: 1
#
# Explanation:
#
# Only building [2,2] is covered as it has at least one building:
# above ([1,2])
# below ([3,2])
# left ([2,1])
# right ([2,3])
# Thus, the count of covered buildings is 1.
# Example 2:
#
#
#
# Input: n = 3, buildings = [[1,1],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
#
# Output: 0
#
# Explanation:
#
# No building has at least one building in all four directions.
# Example 3:
#
#
#
# Input: n = 5, buildings = [[1,3],[3,2],[3,3],[3,5],[5,3]]
#
# Output: 1
#
# Explanation:
#
# Only building [3,3] is covered as it has at least one building:
# above ([1,3])
# below ([5,3])
# left ([3,2])
# right ([3,5])
# Thus, the count of covered buildings is 1.
#
#
# Constraints:
#
# 2 <= n <= 105
# 1 <= buildings.length <= 105
# buildings[i] = [x, y]
# 1 <= x, y <= n
# All coordinates of buildings are unique.
